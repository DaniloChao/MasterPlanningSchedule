# MasterPlanningSchedule
Repository with algortihms for calculating MPS (master planning schedule)
Strategies available would be: fixed lot (fixed), minimum lot (minimum), demand tracking (escort) or flat.

At MPS.py at the top of the page there are some input data that needs to be written as intended: request, forecast, stock... es(safety stock).
The last line should be modified as wished, depending on the strategy you're looking for. Format: "print(available(......()))"
